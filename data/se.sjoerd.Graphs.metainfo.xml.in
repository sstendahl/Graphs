  <summary>Plot and manipulate data</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Graphs is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows you to plot and manipulate your data with ease.
       New data can be imported from a wide variety of filetypes, or generated by equation.
       All data can be manipulated using a variety of operations such as the ability to select, cut, translate, multiply, center and smoothen data, as well as apply any custom transformations on the data.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Graphs supports curve fitting on imported data and offers extensive customization options for the style of the plots.
       You can fine-tune and personalize stylesheets to your liking.</p>
    <p>Graphs is an excellent fit for both plotting and data manipulation.
       The plots created with Graphs can be saved in a variety of formats suitable for sharing and presenting to a wide audience, such as in a scientific publication or presentations.
       Additionally, the option to save plots as vector images allows for easy editing in software like Inkscape for further refinement.
       Graphs is written with the GNOME environment in mind, but should be suitable for any other desktop environment as well.</p>
    <p>For any feedback, questions or general issues, please file an issue on the GitLab page.</p>

  <releases>
    <release version="2.0.0" date="2025-12-02">
      <description>
        <p>Version 2.0 of Graphs is a major update, introducing several new features such as proper equation support and a completely redesigned style editor.</p>
        <p>Different data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Graphs now differentiates between imported data from files, generated data and equations</li>
          <li>Equations now span an infinite range</li>
          <li>Equations can now be edited afterwards, as well as simplified using the item editor</li>
          <li>Equations with undefined values (e.g. 1/x at x=0) are now properly rendered as well</li>
          <li>Operations on equations are now performed analytically, meaning the name of the equation will also change accordingly when performing operations</li>
          <li>Generated data can now be changed afterwards with regard to step size and rendered span</li>
        </ul>
        <p>New Style Editor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Graphs has a completely redesigned style editor with a live preview of the edited styles</li>
          <li>Styles can now be exported</li>
          <li>New styles can now be imported from matplotlib-style files</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Reworked Curve fitting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The confidence band in the curve fitting dialog is now correctly calculated using the delta-method</li>
          <li>The curve fitting dialog now has the option to show residuals</li>
          <li>The parameter values themselves in the curve fitting dialog are no longer rounded (e.g. 421302 used to be rounded to 421000)</li>
          <li>The results in the curve fitting dialog now also show the root mean squared error as a second goodness-of-fit figure</li>
          <li>The curve fitting dialog now shows more useful error messages when things go wrong</li>
          <li>Custom equations in the curve fitting dialog now have an apply button, greatly improving the smoothness when entering new equations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Improved data import:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Revamped the import dialog, where the import settings can now be set independently for multiple files</li>

          <li>Limits can now easily be clicking on the numbers near the axes</li>
          <li>The custom transformation has gained the following extra variables: x_mean, y_mean, x_median, y_median, x_std, y_std and counts</li>
          <li>Settings that affect the canvas (item or figure settings) are now displayed in the sidebar, so you can immediately see the changes on your graph</li>
          <li>Graphs now properly supports mobile screen sizes</li>
          <li>Graphs now inhibits the session when unsaved data is still open</li>
          <li>The resolution (image size) for exported figures can now be set manually</li>
